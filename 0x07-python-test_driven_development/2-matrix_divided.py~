def matrix_divided(matrix, div):
    """Divides each element of a given matrix by a given divider and returns
    a new matrix holding the resulting numbers (rounded to 2 decimal places).

    The function performs argument validation for both the arguments.
    1. matrix has to be a list of lists of integers or floats.
    2. Each row of the matrix must have the same size.
    3. div must be an integer or a float.
    4. div cannot be 0.

    Args:
        matrix (list<list<int>>): The matrix whose elements are divided.
        div (int/float): The number which the elements of the matrix are divided
        by.

    Returns:
        list<list<int>>: A list of lists holding the results of the division of
        the corresponding elements of matrix by div.
