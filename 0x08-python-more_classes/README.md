This directory was created on January 29, 2024 as part of the ALX SE Foundations
project '0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects'.

This project delves deeper into the world of Object Oriented programming
and explores topics such as class attributes vs instance attributes,
class methods vs instance methods vs static methods, using decorators
(properties) instead of getter and setter functions for attributes, public vs
private attributes in python, and the __str__ and__repr__ magic methods.
