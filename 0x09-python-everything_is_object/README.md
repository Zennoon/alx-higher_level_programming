This directory was created on January 30, 2024 as part of the ALX SE Foundations
project '0x09. Python - Everything is object'.

This project focuses on how python handles data (more on objects) and how
aliasing works. It also explores the mutable and immutable data types and how
assignment, duplicates assignment, and aliasing affects these types.
